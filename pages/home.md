## Mission statement

Provide a set of tools to manage, configure and build complex, package based, multi-target (multi-architecture, multi-board, multi-toolchain), intended to **enhance code sharing** and **reusing** during the development of **C/C++** libraries and applications.

## xPacks overview

**xPacks** are general purpose software C/C++ packages, much the same as [npm modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) do so nicely in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## xPack tools

The entire xPack project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/xpack).

The main xPack tools are:

* [xpm]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/) - the package manager ([GitHub](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm))
* [xmake]({{ site.baseurl }}/xmake/) - the project builder ([GitHub](https://github.com/xpack/xmake-js), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmake))
* [xcdl]({{ site.baseurl }}/xcdl/) - the component & configuration framework

## License

Unless otherwise mentioned, all **xPack** tools are provided **free of charge** under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
