## Tools issues

In case you encounter problems while using the xPack tools, please consider the following:

* read the documentation pages
* check the [Known issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/known-issues/)
* check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/faq/)
* check the **xPack** sections in the [GNU MCU Eclipse forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/forum/) for similar problems
* check the GitHub Issues trackers the specific package
    * [xpm tracker](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/issues/))
    * [xmake tracker](https://github.com/xpack/xmake-js/issues/))

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have any experience that you want to share with others, please use the GNU MCU Eclipse [forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/forum/).

If you are convinced you identified a bug (if you have doubts, use the forum), or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the xPack tools, please use the specific GitHub Issues tracker:
* [xpm tracker](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/issues/))
* [xmake tracker](https://github.com/xpack/xmake-js/issues/))

## Web pages issues

If you discover problems in the content of these pages (typos, wrong phrasing, etc), or you have suggestions on how to improve them, you can use the [Web Issues](https://github.com/xpack/xpack.github.io/issues/) tracker.

## Use of private e-mail

Please, please, please: **do not use private e-mail for support**, since such messages will be replied with a link to this page. The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to efficiently use the time; since forum posts and GitHub Issues are archived, other people having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
