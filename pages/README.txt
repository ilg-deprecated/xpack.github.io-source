# The xPack web site

This repository stores the actual, live, xPack project web.

## URL

Thanks to the Travis magic, commits to this Git are automatically reflected at [http://xpack.github.io](http://xpack.github.io).

## GitHub Pages

As all GitHub Pages webs, this is a fully static site.

## Jekyll

This is a Jekyll generated site, but since it uses plug-ins, it cannot be automatically processed by GitHub Pages, and requires the build to be performed off-line.
